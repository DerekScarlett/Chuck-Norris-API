How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, API, JSON

Whith this app I used a click function when you press "press"" which acces an api that sends back a json response and then I append to the DOM a random joke.

Optimizations
If I have a chance to go back to this I think I would add a database for the user to save the thier favorite jokes and rate them based on how much they make you laugh.

Lessons Learned:
I learned how to acces an api and target what properties I want from the response.
